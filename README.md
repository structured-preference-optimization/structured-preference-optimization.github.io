# Structured Preference Optimization (SPO) for Vision-Language Long-Horizon Task Planning

## Overview
Structured Preference Optimization (SPO) is a framework designed to enhance reasoning and decision-making in long-horizon task planning using vision-language models. SPO introduces a **Preference-Based Scoring and Optimization** mechanism and **Curriculum-Guided Training**, enabling more effective reasoning across complex, multi-step tasks.

Additionally, SPO is validated using **ExtendaBench**, a comprehensive benchmark covering a wide range of tasks in **VirtualHome** and **Habitat 2.0** simulators.

## Key Features
- **SPO Framework**: Enhances long-horizon reasoning through structured preference evaluation.
- **ExtendaBench Benchmark**: Includes 1,509 tasks across four difficulty levels.
- **Curriculum-Guided Training**: Gradual exposure to tasks of increasing complexity.
